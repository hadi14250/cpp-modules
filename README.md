# cpp-modules

Inspired by the core principles of object-oriented programming, this project delves into encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. We start with fundamental C++ concepts and progress to advanced topics, including templates and containers. Utilizes C++ features to create modular, scalable, and efficient applications.

## C++ Module Summaries

- **cpp00**: Focuses on basic C++ concepts such as classes, member functions, and standard I/O streams. It covers initialization lists, static and const members, and other foundational topics.

- **cpp01**: Explores memory allocation, pointers to member functions, and references. It also covers the use of the switch statement.

- **cpp02**: Introduces ad-hoc polymorphism and operator overloading, along with the Orthodox Canonical Class Form. It emphasizes creating and managing classes with these features.

- **cpp03**: Covers inheritance, including how to derive classes and manage base and derived relationships.

- **cpp04**: Delves into subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, and interfaces, highlighting how to create and use these advanced class structures.

- **cpp05**: Focuses on repetition constructs and exception handling, teaching how to handle errors and manage control flow.

- **cpp06**: Introduces C++ casting techniques, including `static_cast`, `dynamic_cast`, `const_cast`, and `reinterpret_cast`.

- **cpp07**: Covers C++ templates, including template classes and functions, and how to use them for generic programming.

- **cpp08**: Explores templated containers, iterators, and algorithms, emphasizing their use in standard template libraries.

- **cpp09**: Focuses on the Standard Template Library (STL), including its various components and how to utilize them effectively.
